## Ibrahim's Comments
I follow Verge Tech quite frequently and think it's one of the better tech newspapers out there. Its good to keep an eye on what the newest thing in town is as well as just summarize really long papers on AI and tech. Papers are often 15-20 pages while they shorten them pretty nicely.
